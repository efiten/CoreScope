// minute - any node past it is unambiguously a spammer whether the count
// saturates or not. (An exact COUNT cannot move into SQL because the precise
// window check needs parseRelayTS over the mixed first_seen formats.)
// floodAdvertRowCap is the production row cap; tests pass a smaller cap
// directly, so there is no mutable package state to race on.
