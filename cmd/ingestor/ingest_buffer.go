// IngestBuffer decouples MQTT message receipt from DB writes (#1608).
//
// On boot the ingestor must subscribe to MQTT immediately, but the single
// SQLite writer (#1283) can be held for minutes by a startup migration
// (e.g. a large CREATE INDEX) or prune. Without buffering, every QoS-0 packet
// received in that window is lost. IngestBuffer holds received work in a
// bounded FIFO and a single consumer goroutine drains it once Ready() is
// called — i.e. once the write path is free.
//
// A single consumer preserves the single-writer invariant: jobs run one at a
// time, exactly as paho's in-order handler did before. Submit never blocks the
// MQTT delivery goroutine; if the buffer is full it drops and counts (bounded
// memory). Buffering replays the original messages, so it introduces NO
// duplicates (contrast: a QoS-1 broker-queue would).
